"I remember in the car driving up and he [Harry] said, 'You know how to curtsy right?'" Meghan told viewers. "And I just thought it was a joke."</p><p><strong>READ</strong> <strong>MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'It was terrifying': Prince Harry says William 'screamed and shouted' at him after he announced exit</a></p><p><a href=#>'He had a list': Meghan Markle reveals what Prince Harry was looking for in a partner when they first met</a></p><p>Reflecting on the former ‘Suits’ star’s claims, a TikTok user shared an old video of the retired tennis ace, 41, performing a curtsy for Queen Elizabeth when the monarch visited the 2010 Wimbledon Championships in London. The user also slammed Meghan for disrespecting the British culture while writing "Shocking! Even Meghan's American bestie Serena knew how to curtsy to the queen. No excuses please!"</p><p>The video soon garnered immense social media attention with one user saying, “MM thought all this in docuseries about her curtsying, etc would have the woke crowd support her, but it's backfired real hard.” “Meghan Markle revealed FERGIE taught her how to curtsy before she met the Queen. why did everyone forget this part of the Oprah interview?????” said the second user while the third said “haay...used to love Meghan😏 that curtsy story of hers was really unbelievable. Unless yeah she lived in the mountains or something.” Another user said “Megan’s exaggerated curtsy In the docuseries was hysterical!! Love her 👏👏👏”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/80cd86f9-6d91-4741-9da0-af126cdb13bf.1409487825><p>Despite the backlash, a number of TikTok users stood up in Meghan’s defense. “Ahhh Meghan’s point wasn’t that she had to curtsy to the queen in public/formal events but in private. As in meeting your boyfriends grandma… and they probably rehearsed in the car so that she could do it almost perfectly,” wrote one user with another adding “Meghan could've been extremely nervous and forgotten things, remember yall this is a world leader”</p><p>Meghan performed a number of public curtsies to Queen Elizabeth II during her lifetime, first during a Christmas service in 2017, then again at her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, in Berkshire, England. She performed her last curtsy to the queen in September 2022, when her coffin left Westminster Abbey in London for St George's Chapel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZWctaK6jKaYq6OcmnqjuMCsq56cXaTDpr6MrJyrnZ6Weri1y6WgmqWjYrC2vtOssGabnJ69</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
