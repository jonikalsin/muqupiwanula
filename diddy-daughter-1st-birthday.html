He has never been arrested or charged in connection with the crime, and <a class=underline-link href=#>he has vehemently denied the allegations</a>.</p><p>The rumors largely rest on comments made during a 2008 police confession by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Duane “Keefe D” Davis</a>, who was&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>charged with ‘Pac’s long-unsolved murder last month</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/diddys-son-king-combs-wants-to-sample-more-classic-bad-boy-songs-250x142.jpg alt="Diddy’s Son King Combs Wants To Sample More Classic Bad Boy Songs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Diddy’s Son King Combs Wants To Sample More Classic Bad Boy Songs</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 8, 2023</p></a><p>The 60-year-old former South Side Compton Crip told detectives that&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>he and Puff had discussed a $1million deal to kill both 2Pac and Suge Knight</a>, who were feuding with Diddy’s Bad Boy Records at the time.</p><p>Davis claimed that the Harlem-bred mogul told him during a meeting at Greenblatt’s Deli in Los Angeles that he wanted to “get ride of them dudes.” After ‘Pac’s death, however, Keefe D said that the South Side Compton Crips never received the alleged $500,000 payment from the record executive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibopyUrnqlrdSgn62domJ%2BtMCMm6CrrJiZrro%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
