Shanquella Robinson, 25, her best friend Khalil, Wenter Donovan, Alysse Hyatt, Daejhanae Jackson, and Nazeer Wiggins traveled to Cabo, Mexico, on Friday, October 28, 2022.</p><p>On Saturday, October 29, 2022, Shanquella's mother, Salamondra Robinson, claimed they got a call from Khalil informing them that Shanquella was "sleeping" and "not feeling well" and had puked a few times. She claimed that since they believed Shanquella was suffering from a <a href=# rel>hangover</a>, they were not worried. It turned out that that was not the case.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>21-year-old dies of caffeine overdose after drinking 'anti-hangover' protein shake, devastated father issues warning on social media</a></p><p><a href=#>Video shows man breaking into liquor store and passing out after drinking too much alcohol</a></p><p>"After he told me that she was resting and not feeling good and that she had thrown up, I told him just to call us and keep us informed on how she is doing," Salamondra said. Shanquella had <a href=# rel>alcohol poisoning, </a>Khalil informed Salamondra when he got back on the line. Salamondra claimed she was a little at ease, though, since she trusted Khalil. "We were more calm I guess, because we trust him and we kind of believe what he was telling us."</p><p>However, the next time Khalil called he informed her that an ambulance had arrived at their villa. "He told me that there were about 3 ambulances there and they trying to resuscitate Shanquella," Salamondra said.</p><p>Salamondra said that Khalil then put them on hold, and they were confused because he had just spoken to them, <a href=# rel=nofollow>THENCBEAT</a> reported.</p><p>Sadly, Shanquella died. Khalil and the five others had to leave Mexico quickly to avoid getting into legal trouble, so they came back to the US. In an effort to appear innocent, Khalil kept approaching the family. Her death was not caused by drinking, according to Shanquella's autopsy, which also found that she had been beaten and suffered from a broken neck and a cracked spine. Salamondra claimed that Shanquella's face was swollen, she had a knot on her head, her eyes were swollen, and her lips were split in photos that were sent to her and her family, THENCBEAT reported.</p><p>Now a video has surfaced on social media of a woman beating Shanquella in a hotel room. In the video put out by North Carolina Beat, Shanquella is seen naked while a woman is beating her on the head repeatedly. The alleged friends in the room are just recording the brutal attack on their phones. At one point, Shanquella is on the ground and the alleged friends are cheering the other woman on. The woman is seen hitting Shanquella in the head multiple times again.</p><p>Throughout the video, while the alleged friends are seen in the room recording the fight, one man repeatedly says, “At least fight back."</p><p>Social media users came down hard on the people in the room. A Twitter user wrote, "Because they all should get exposed. #shanquellarobinson"</p><p>Another user tweeted, "Just sick. Be careful who you keep around man. Don’t ignore the signs. The even sicker part is that they are all men who you would think should protect. I’ve hated fighting culture my entire life from middle til this day. It’s absolutely pointless!!! #ripshanquella"</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Just sick. Be careful who you keep around man. Don’t ignore the signs.
