Diouf, who has been striving to improve her 200 meters time in preparation for the 2024 Games, lamented the marginalization of the trans community and described the ban as being hounded. The decision by the governing council of World Athletics to prohibit transgender women who have undergone male puberty from competing in women’s events has sparked controversy.</p><p>Expressing disbelief over the decision, Diouf noted that transgender women have historically been allowed to compete if their testosterone levels were below a specified threshold. However, she feels excluded and marginalized by the recent ruling. Diouf, a Senegal-born athlete who transitioned in France, emphasized the importance of the right to live as transgender individuals wish, highlighting the feeling of being hounded and refused that right.</p><p>The tighter measures implemented by World Athletics concerning transgender participation in elite events have been met with backlash from LGBTQI advocacy groups, who view the exclusion of trans athletes as discrimination. The President of World Athletics, Sebastian Coe, emphasized the challenge of balancing conflicting needs and rights between different groups while prioritizing fairness for female athletes.</p><p>The impact of the ban on transgender and athletes with Differences in Sex Development (DSD) has been significant, affecting prominent figures such as Caster Semenya and Francine Niyonsaba. The restriction and stringent regulations have sparked criticism from experts, with endocrinologist Alain Berliner labeling it as a form of transphobia. Berliner highlighted Diouf’s hormonal status and physiological and legal classification as a woman, questioning the basis for the ban.</p><p>The controversy surrounding the ban and its implications for transgender athletes continues to fuel debates on the intersection of inclusivity, fairness, and discrimination in sports.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiunqqVYq%2Bmtc2gZKGnpaOxprCMn6meppOderW%2BwKeqoJ2embKzedKpqaKmpJq%2FbrTApZmaZZSevLayjJ2cnKqZmsBuu8uypKmhk6h6o63NZp2oql2pv6K60mauqKWVo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
