Gipson, 16, who tragically passed away following injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision on Monday, November 13. Hayden, a student at Midd-West High School, was actively involved in basketball and had aspirations to join the upcoming bowling team.</p><p>Both the Shoe Department at the Susquehanna Valley Mall and Burger King in Middleburg were Hayden’s places of employment. He previously worked at Burger King. Outside of school and work, Hayden found solace in fishing, exploring on his four-wheeler, and riding alongside his father on motorcycle trips. His fondness for sloths was well-known among family and friends.</p><p>Tajsa Miller posted on Facebook,</p><p>“Breaks my heart Hayden was a great kid and looked forward to a lot. Prayers for the Gipson family”</p><p>Hayden’s siblings held a special place in his heart, despite any playful sibling antics. Friends and family are invited to pay their respects during visitation at Beavertown God’s Missionary Church, 1693 Creek Rd., Middleburg, on Friday, November 17, from 9 to 11 a.m. The funeral service, to be officiated by ministers from the church, will follow at 11 a.m. at the same location, with burial at Glendale Cemetery in Middleburg.</p><p>A Memorial Fund has been established through First National Bank to assist with funeral expenses. Donations can be made payable to the “Hayden L. Gipson Memorial Fund.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ktaLFw56lZp%2BZpcCwuoyonWalmZmxrbHBrqmgZaaWeqW1xKxkoqZdlnqkrdFmmJybmZmyr8CMqJmirKWWv7p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
