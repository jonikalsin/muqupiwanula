protect himself from conservative, pro-Second Amendment lawmakers like Representative Madison Cawthorn.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cawthorn said at an event in Macon County, <a href=# id=mol-e2cf6a10-0a53-11ec-8958-c18493341894>North Carolina</a> on Sunday that ‘rigged elections’ will end in ‘bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then on Monday night, Swalwell suggested he fears that Cawthorn could violently lash out in a way that would require him to have a bulletproof vest to protect himself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘A staffer emailed me yesterday asking if I wanted to buy a bulletproof vest because ‘it’s now an approved expense by the House,’ the <a href=# id=mol-e2ce0a80-0a53-11ec-8958-c18493341894>California</a> congressman tweeted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I didn’t believe she was for real,’ Swalwell continued. ‘Turns out she was thinking about people like Cawthorn — NOT even people outside of my office building — BUT inside.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The House now allows lawmakers to expense bulletproof vests if they desire one– an obvious response to the January 6 attack on the Capitol that resulted in five deaths as rioters protested the 2020 presidential election results in the aftermath of a ‘Stop the Steal’ rally.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The congressman’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Swalwell’s tweet.&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-7499d1f70060c209

continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place — and it’s bloodshed’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cawthorn, as well as other far-right lawmakers, still insist President Joe Biden only won through a series of fraudulent voting practices, further exacerbated by the mass amount of mail-in ballots received and allowed in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The North Carolina lawmaker, the youngest ever elected to Congress, rail against the 2020 election at the event on Sunday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The things that we are wanting to fight for, it doesn’t matter if our votes don’t count,’ Cawthorn told the crowd of around 350-400 people. ‘Because, you know, if our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, then it’s going to lead to one place — and it’s bloodshed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I will tell you, as much as I am willing to defend our liberty at all costs, there is nothing that I would dread doing more than having to pick up arms against a fellow American,’ he added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And the way that we can have recourse against that is if we all passionately demand that we have election security in all 50 states.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Video of Cawthorn’s remarks were posted to the Macon County Republican Party Facebook page. On the page, Cawthorn was also pictured at the event signing a camouflage shotgun that could be won via raffle.</p><img decoding=async id=i-d633610f656aa919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/31/12/47324463-9943253-image-a-15_1630411164688.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-d633610f656aa919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/31/12/47324463-9943253-image-a-15_1630411164688.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Also at the Sunday event, Cawthorn signed a shotgun that could be won via a weapons raffle</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After those remarks were widely circulated on Twitter – coupled with images of him holding the weapon – it was suggested that Cawthorn was advocating violence to prevent voter fraud.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But a spokesman for the representative said in a Monday statement that Cawthorn was saying the exact opposite.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In his comments, Congressman Cawthorn is CLEARLY advocating for violence not to occur over election integrity questions,’ Luke Ball said. ‘He fears others would erroneously choose that route and strongly states that election integrity issues should be resolved peacefully and never through violence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cawthorn, Ball continued in the statement, was ‘in no way supporting or advocating for any form of violence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson also attended the event in Macon County on Sunday and signed the shotgun.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6yurcPEpaNmq5GuwG6%2F05qdn52iYrynssSrnJ1lpKR6o8HYZphmmqWhuabAz6umqJ5dq7K0wIyfpqtloKe8tbHCraCopl2WtKK1zayrZqWRmba0u81mmpqvpJ28s7qO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
