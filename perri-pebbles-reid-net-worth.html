All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Perri Pebbles Reid? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $25 million, mostly earned through a successful career in music. However, she’s now working as a minister in Atlanta as “Sister Perri”, and as she continues her endeavors, it is expected that her net worth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Perri Pebbles Reid Net Worth $25 million</h3><p>At the age of 16, Perri was given a production deal with a local musician, however the deal was called off when it was later discovered that she was pregnant. Her next career move would be in 1981, when she became the backing vocalist of the funk band Con Funk Shun which was the band of percussionist Bill Summers, helping write the band’s single entitled “Body Lovers”. She then made a demo tape after meeting George L. Smith which led to the creation of the video “Mercedes Boy”, and to her being signed by MCA. She recorded several hit songs as a solo artist during the late 1980s up to the 1990s, including “Giving You the Benefit”, “Girlfriend”, and “Love Makes Things Happen”.</p><p>In 1989, she formed the production company Pebbitone and her own record label Savvy Records. Eventually this led to the creation of TLC which Pebbitone managed. The girl group – which originally consisted of “T-Boz”, “Left Eye” and “Chilli” – was formed in 1991 and would find great success in the early 1990s up to the 2000s. This increased Reid’s net worth significantly. A few of the group’s successful singles include “Waterfalls”, “No Scrubs”, “Unpretty”, and “Creep”, and they recorded four multi-platinum albums, one of which is “CrazySexyCool”, the only album by a female group to receive diamond certification. They also received a Million certification for the album “FanMail”. The group would sell 65 million records worldwide and would win numerous awards including five Grammys. Despite this, the band filed for bankruptcy in 1995 due to alleged mismanagement by Perri. The conflict resulted in numerous problems.</p><p>In 1997, Reid was converted, and adopted a new name – “Sister Perri” – and founded the Women of God Changing Lives Ministries (WOGCL). She is an ordained minister there and preaches as well as making gospel music. In 2008, she released her fourth album and debut gospel album after 13 years, entitled “Prophetic Flows Vol 1 & 2”. The album would reach the 12th spot of the Billboard Gospel Album Chart. Three years later she would become the executive producer and host of the national R&B search by Essence.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Perri has married five times, to the unnamed father of her first child only lasted for a year. She was later married to George L. Smith in 1985, and after that ended, she married L.A. Reid in 1989 but divorced in 1996 after the problems with TLC. In 2000 she married retired MLB player Otis Nixon, but after divorce in 2004, in 2010 she married Excel Sharieff. She’s known to have a son and a daughter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=5.7286432160804><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.3571428571429><td>1</td><td>Cousin of singer <a href=#>Cherrelle</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>Has a son, Aaron, with Antonio Reid.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>Has a daughter, Ashley (b. 1983), with George Smith.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Founded Savvy Records in the mid 90s and went on to produce and manage TLC.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>License to Drive</td><td>1988</td><td>performer: "MERCEDES BOY" / writer: "MERCEDES BOY"</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Beverly Hills Cop II</td><td>1987</td><td>performer: "Love/Hate"</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=6><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Art of Organized Noize</td><td>2016</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>The Wendy Williams Show</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Unsung</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Behind the Music</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Ebony/Jet Showcase</td><td>1988-1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Soul Train</td><td>1988-1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself / Herself - Guest</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Party Machine with Nia Peeples</td><td>1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The 18th Annual American Music Awards</td><td>1991</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Big Break</td><td>1990</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The 3rd Annual Soul Train Music Awards</td><td>1989</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself - Presenter</td></tr><tr><td>Showtime at the Apollo</td><td>1989</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Guest Host</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>New American Bandstand 1965</td><td>1988</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Top of the Pops</td><td>1988</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1889966_Pebbles/1889966_Beverly-Hills-Cop-II-1987.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1889966_Pebbles/1889966_License-to-Drive-1988.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1889966_Pebbles/1889966_The-Art-of-Organized-Noize-2016.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqmcq6qZYr2mrsGlnKxlopq2pXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
