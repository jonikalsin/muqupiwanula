The involvement of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) through its subsidiary SRJ Sports Investments has sparked debates and discussions regarding the ownership and future prospects of PFL. In this article, we will delve into the details surrounding the ownership of PFL and analyze the implications of Saudi Arabia's investment in the MMA promotion.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Saudi Arabia's Investment in PFL</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>SRJ Sports Investments, a subsidiary of the PIF, has acquired a minority stake in the <a href=#>PFL</a>, marking Saudi Arabia's foray into the world of MMA. This strategic investment, reportedly exceeding US$100 million, is aimed at supporting PFL's global expansion, facilitating the recruitment of top fighters, and bolstering its fanbase. Additionally, SRJ's investment entails the establishment of the 'PFL MENA' regional league, set to launch in 2024, and the development of 'PFL PPV Super Fights' series of events in Saudi Arabia and the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Vision Behind the Investment</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>SRJ's investment in PFL aligns with Saudi Arabia's broader vision to accelerate the growth of the sports sector in the kingdom and the MENA region. The investment aims to foster local and regional talent in martial arts, promote gender equality in sports, and create new opportunities in the sports industry. The chairman of SRJ, Bander Bin Mogren, emphasized the investment's role in shaping a new era of sports in Saudi Arabia and driving the growth of the domestic sports economy.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>PFL's Global Expansion and Saudi Arabia's Role</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Notably, PFL's founder and chairman, <a href=#>Donn Davis</a>, expressed the organization's commitment to becoming a global co-leader in MMA.
