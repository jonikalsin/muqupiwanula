But first, this article will examine the four highest-rated <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> movies and TV Shows.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=PunkD></span><strong>Punk’D</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In 2003 Kutcher hooked up with MTV to create an elaborate show that aimed to prank unsuspecting Hollywood stars and other celebrities.

When the show premiered in 2003, actor Frankie Muniz became its first victim to get “Punk’D.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kucher hosted the show from 2003 till 2007, when the series supposedly ended. During this time, the show pranked Hollywood stars like Beyonce, Serena Williams, Katie Holmes, Nick Lachey, Halle Berry, Justin Timberlake, etc. Finally, in 2012 five years after the series ended, “Punk’D” returned to the screens.</p><p>However, this time instead of having Kutcher as host, the show returned with a different celebrity host every week, which included Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Dax Shepard, and Bam Margera.
