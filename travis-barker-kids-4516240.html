Ironically, the man who beat the skins on “Stay Together For The Kids,” off of blink’s Take Off Your Pants And Jacket album, shared two children with his ex-wife, Miss USA 1995 <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shanna Moakler</a></strong>. The two reportedly began dating in 2002, wed in 2004, and finalized their divorce in 2008. In that span of time, they welcomed two children into the world: son <strong>Landon</strong>&nbsp;and daughter <strong>Alabama</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Travis-Barker-kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to these two children, Travis is a stepfather to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya</strong></a>, Shanna’s daughter with ex-fiancé <strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong>. Though they aren’t biologically related, Travis and Atiana have a close bond together, one that was featured on the family’s short-lived MTV reality television series, Meet the Barkers. Travis’s return to reality television was set when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he proposed</a> to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kourtney Kardashian</a>&nbsp;</strong>in October 2021. Their mutual families have blended well together, and in April 2022, the Barkers and the Kardashian-Disicks all walked the red carpet ahead of&nbsp;The Kardashians&nbsp;premiere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Travis-Barker-Kids-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>With that, it’s safe to say that&nbsp;the chances of Travis and Shanna getting back together are zero. Trav and Shanna attempted to rekindle their relationship in 2009, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV News</a>, to no avail. The couple has done their best to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>co-parent their children</a>, despite the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ups and downs</a> of their relationship. But, despite the clashing between Travis and his ex, they’ll forever be connected due to the amazing kids they’ve brought into the world.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Travis and Kourtney got married in May 2022, and it’s clear that they love being husband and wife. Besides their happy marriage, the pair are also now parents together! The couple welcomed their first baby together in November 2023, and it’s clear that Kravis are excited for this new chapter in their life together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Find out more about Travis’ kids below.</p><h2>Landon Barker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/travis-barker-kids-landon-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Landon Asher Barker was born on October 9, 2003, a year before his mom Shanna and dad Travis tied the knot. As of 2021, Landon seems interested in fashion (his Instagram is full of pictures of him posing in clothes) and possibly acting. Landon was featured in <strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong>’s movie, Downfalls High, based on his album Tickets To My Downfall (which Travis produced and played drums on<strong>.</strong>)</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Like his father, Landon has dabbled in music. While Travis is associated with punk rock, Landon – under the moniker <strong>OTG Landon </strong>– released a rap song, “Holiday,” in November 2020. Two years earlier, when he was only fifteen years old, Landon released a music video for his song, “Don’t Need Her.” In 2019, Landon adopted the OTG Landon (short for “On The Grind”) name and put out “Trust.” While his musical efforts have been mostly rap, he did pay homage to his punk lineage on Halloween 2020 by releasing a faithful cover of “Skulls” by the legendary horror punk band <strong>The Misfits.&nbsp;</strong>He also released his debut solo single “Friends With Your EX” in September 2023.</p><h2>Alabama Barker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/travis-barker-kids-alabama-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Alabama Luella Barker was born on December 24, 2005. As a young modern woman, Alabama has seemingly focused on being an online influencer. With 715k Instagram followers and 1.4 million on TikTok, Alabama has a captive audience that she treats with photos of her adventures (while also showing off her latest fashion.) In March 2021, Alabama used KVD Beauty products to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cover up some of Travis’ facial tattoos</a> in an IG video. During the video, Alabama and Travis goofed around, and it was clear that these two have a warm, loving bond.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Just like her father and her brother, Alabama also has dabbled in music. In 2016, she released a cover of “Blue Christmas” that featured her older brother on drums. A year later, she released “Flowers,” a Bruno Mars “When I Was Your Man” cover, as well as “Our House,” an original song. 2018 saw her put out “Heartbreaker” and another holiday track, “Mistletoe.” Since then, Alabama has left the music to her father.</p><h2>Atiana De La Hoya</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya was born on March 29, 1999. She is Shanna Moakler’s eldest child. Her father is famed boxer Oscar De La Hoya. Shanna and Oscar were together from 1997 to 2000. The relationship ended abruptly after Shanna, who was watching the Latin Grammys from home, saw Oscar take another woman to the show, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>. Atiana was just five years old when Travis married her mother, and despite the breakup, she has remained close with him. She was even featured on Meet The Barkers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>When she was 14, Atiana began modeling but decided to give it up in high school. “I just wanted to hang out with friends. I didn’t want to have a career or work,” Atiana told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. In 2021, she’s back in the game, signing with LA Models. She also paints custom bags for celebrity clients (You can see some of her amazing works by checking out&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@artbyatiana</a>.) Atiana has been a fixture in Travis’s life, going on family vacations (along with Kourtney Kardashian) and celebrating holidays with him and her siblings.</p><h2>Rocky 13</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>After a disappointing IVF journey, which Kourtney and Travis documented on Hulu’s&nbsp;The Kardashians, the 44-year-old announced <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she was pregnant</a> on June 16, 2023! Kourtney was in the audience at Blink 182’s Los Angeles show and held up a sign reading “Travis I’m Pregnant” — just like a female fan did back in the 1999 video for “All The Small Things.” On June 24, 2023, Kourtney and Travis held a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gender reveal party</a> for their friends and family where they confirmed they are expecting a boy!</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>The pair did have a few hard times during the pregnancy, like when Kourtney needed emergency fetal surgery at the beginning of September. Travis flew home amid blink-182’s tour to be there for his wife. After everything, he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), thanking fans for their support. “God is great. I flew home for a life-threatening emergency surgery for our baby that I’m so grateful went well,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>While the pair have yet to make an official announcement that they’ve <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their baby</a>, it was reported that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they’d had their son,</a> according to a report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;on November 4, 2023. While the pair haven’t yet publicly revealed their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby’s name</a>, Travis did say that they were planning on naming him&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rocky 13 Barker</a>&nbsp;</strong>in an interview on the&nbsp;One Life One Chance&nbsp;podcast, and they later confirmed it to be the child’s name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OrmK%2Bho2Kvor7Knqlmo5mZwG6AlGpta2xgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
