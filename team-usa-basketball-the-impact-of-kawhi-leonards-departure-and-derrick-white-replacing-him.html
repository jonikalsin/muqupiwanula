The enthusiasm has somewhat died down as Los Angeles Clippers' star Kawhi Leonard withdrew from the Team USA roster due to previous injuries he suffered during the last NBA season. However, this surprising plot twist has still created a hole in the team and they have now selected Boston Celtics guard Derrick White to his roster. We dive into the fallout of Leonard's leaving and what it could spell for Team USA come an Olympic year.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1><br>The Blow of Losing Leonard</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the report on Leonard fueling his rest and not return this season out at one point was damaging enough, Kawhi withdrawing from Team USA represented a major hit for Gregg Popovich. This likely means the absence of two-time NBA Finals MVP and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. He made the team in part because of his two-way excellence and reputation as a six-time NBA All-Star, making him an anticipated force at both ends of the floor over Friday's opening game against France. But now that he made it his mission to prepare for the upcoming NBA season, they needed another four as soon as possible.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1><br>The Rise of Derrick White</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Now, with Leonard out of the picture - and White being selected to fill some big shoes in place of a proven commodity like Leonard- all eyes are on his team. White is a lockdown defender and played significant minutes during the Boston Celtics' run to their NBA Championship, so he should have an inside track on playing for Team USA. That he can make a two-way impact and has prior experience with Team USA dating back to the 2019 FIBA World Cup provides him beneficiary versatility in terms of lineup structure. His addition poses a new wrinkle to the roster and his defensive skills will be very valuable for Team USA.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1><br>Analyzing the Decision</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The choice of White over other hypothetical candidates such as Jalen Brunson was interesting. Brunson had a respectable offensive season in the team's backcourt last year, but ultimately it was White's defensively ability that kept him on board. In addition, the committee may have taken Brunson's recovery from a broken hand into account as it selected White to suit up for Team USA in Paris.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1><br>Effects of This Move on Team USA style</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Leonard's absence will force Team USA to readjust a game plan and shift dynamics with White inserted in the fold. Whether it be defending the run on early downs or pass rushing in sub-packages, their new acquisition will require them to play to his strengths and style of player. The team could use some more pieces to mix and match this summer, but White's relative youth as a plug-into-the-system fit may prove vital in keeping the U.S. competitive level Olympian for years to come.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1><br>The Road Ahead</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Now, with the 2024 Olympics just four years away, Team USA must pick up the pieces and come together as a unit after Leonard's sudden exit. Derrick White has everything to gain from finally representing Team USA, playing up his defensive intensity on this grand stage in which so attention must be paid defensively for a crazy Team US squad looking to come back strong and out of Paris. While the team preps for future contests, all eyes will be on White and whether he can step up when it matters mind you<br>In summary, Team USA loses Kawhi Leonard and changes the dynamics while redeems Derrick White as his defaulter. While the eyes of the basketball world sort out what to do with their 2024 Olympic preparations, all will be watching Team USA and how well they function during a transition that has brought them more firepower in recent weeks. This is shaping up to be an exciting showcase of the world's best basketball players with White primed for a bit more interest and excitement in France as part of Team USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mimpbGdpbakv46tnJqlXarAonnBmqqknaSXrq24jK2fnmWZor2ir9Nmpp9lm5bEqbWMpZyoppGnsbR5w56nmqqkqr%2BmecCnm2aclae%2Fqq%2FKZq6hoaSaerOxz6WYnKGenHqptcw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
