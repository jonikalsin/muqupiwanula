But he has not posted any videos on his Youtube channel nor his Instagram account. Maybe he is just focusing on his studies. So, letâ€™s see how much we know about Jennaâ€™s sibling Markus.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lovely_Bonding_Between_the_Siblings></span>Lovely Bonding Between the Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Markus Ortega lives with his parents and his siblings.
