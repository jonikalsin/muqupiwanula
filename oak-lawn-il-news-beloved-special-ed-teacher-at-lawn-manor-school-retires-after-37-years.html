I didn’t expect that. It touched my heart,” Ryan said. “I will remember you guys forever, thank you.”</p><p>Ryan’s daughter started plotting with the school staff weeks ago to surprise her with a goodbye celebration that included all her immediate family, and even some from out of town.</p><p>Ryan’s daughter Jeannette Vadbunker is also a special ed teacher in another district.</p><p>“She’s gentle, she’s patient, she’s loving,” Vadbunker said. “She always leads with her heart.”</p><p>“Everyone is going to miss her,” parent Michelle Higgins said. “It takes a special person to be a teacher, but she was really, truly a phenomenal teacher.”</p><p>“She’s a good listener to her students, making sure she’s making them excited about learning,” Lawn Manor Principal Heather Wills said.</p><p>“Work on the whole child, not just reading and math,” Ryan said. “Whatever they come in with, that’s what we work with.
