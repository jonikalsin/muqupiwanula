Later he joined its ‘splinter group’, a sketch troupe named The Dead Alewives, which was orientated more towards uncensored and improvisational humor; the troupe released the “Take Down the Grand Master” album in 1996. In the course of the next couple of years, Harmon frequented Milwaukee’s club scene, honing his skills, and regularly appearing at the Safehouse free comedy stage, where he rose to fame due to his comedy routine, which included a song about masturbation.</p><p>In 1999, alongside Rob Schrab, Dan co-created a humoristic Sci-Fi TV series pilot episode named “Heat Vision and Jack”, with Jack Black and Owen Wilson in the main roles and Ben Stiller as its director.
