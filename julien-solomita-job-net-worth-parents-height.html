The beauty was depicted in a black-and-white photograph donning a princess-styled gown, with long sleeves and a deep V-neck on the lace upper half of the dress. The bottom was made of a stunning tulle skirt that fell down behind her into a train. She had a bright smile on her face and added some fun to the photo by donning a pair of white-rimmed sunglasses.

So, we are engaged,’ reported&nbsp;E! News.</p><p>The proposal took place, Julien clarified, “maybe longer ago than you think,” adding that despite Marbles giving him a temporary ring of his own, he removed it during Twitch streams.</p><p>“I’m very excited, and it feels good to get the words out because I wanted to tell you for a while and I didn’t because it was giving me anxiety so I just kind of held onto it,” the groom shared at the time. “I think today I realized it was kind of flipped, and it was giving me more anxiety to kind of hold on to it, so there’s the news.”</p><p>Jenna has been virtually inactive since 2020 and stopped creating content after she received hate for earlier videos that were labeled as racist content.
