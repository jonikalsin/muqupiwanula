His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home.</p><p>According to Lionel, Dahmer was “oddly thrilled” by the sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones, which he initially called his “fiddlesticks”. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their bones were located.</p><p>In 1968, the family moved to Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio. This address was their third in two years, and the Dahmers’ sixth address since marriage.</p><p>The home stood in one and a half acres of woodland, with a small hut only a short walk from the house where Dahmer began collecting large insects such as dragonflies and moths and the skeletons of small animals such as chipmunks and squirrels. Some of these remains were preserved in jars of formaldehyde and stowed within the hut.</p><h2>Jeffrey Dahmer children: Does Jeffrey Dahmer have children?</h2><p>Jeffrey Dahmer never got married and he didn’t have any children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kt6ayxaucsmWUlrWusdFmmqGhnJm%2FprqMnaaeq12fsqey0Z6wZpyRnbqmvoyhmK%2BdXZi1qrjDq5ynZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
