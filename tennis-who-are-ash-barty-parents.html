Get to know all about the Barty family</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>World No.1 <strong>Ash Barty</strong> has been the dominant player on the WTA tour for a lengthy period now. The Australian has been arguably the most consistent player on women’s circuit, owing to which she has regularly made the deep end of almost every tournament, across surfaces.</p><p>After winning her maiden French Open title in 2019, which was also her first Grand Slam, Barty has managed to hang onto the top spot in the rankings. She has had a very good run at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wimbledon 2021</a>. Interestingly, Barty had never made it past the fourth round at the All England Club before this year.</p><p>The 25-year-old came into Wimbledon without playing any warm-up tournament on grass, but has surprised one and all by making the finals. Moreover, the Aussie girl has dropped only one set throughout the tournament, which was in the first round against Suarez Navarro. Since then, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barty</a> has been ruthless in beating her opponents. Even in the semifinals, she was sublime in beating former Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber. Furthermore, she has played only two tie break sets in the lead up to the finals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ash was born to Robert and Josie Barty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-20210709-WA0177_copy_1600x900-1024x576.jpg><p>Ash Barty’s parents are Robert and Josie Barty. While Barty’s father works with the Australian government, her mother is a radiologist in Australia. Ash also has two sisters called Ali and Sarah.</p><p>The diminutive Barty is also a patriot, who is very proud of her roots. She also became the first Australian to win in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Garros</a> since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Margaret Court</a> in 1973. In June 2019, she also became the first Australian player to become world No 1 since Evonne Goolagong in 1976.</p><p>Barty has a win/loss record of 35-7 for 2021 and given her recent form and confidence, she can create history at Wimbledon. However, regardless of the result, she will hold onto her top spot in the WTA rankings even after Wimbledon.</p><p><strong>Also read</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How many languages does Matteo Berrettini speak?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57056lp6GjYsSpu4yaqZ5lkai1bq7Aq6uyZaCWv6a606xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
